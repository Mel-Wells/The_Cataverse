# Cataverse

## Description
Cataverse is a 90s-themed interactive website where cats take center stage! Inspired by the chaotic and colorful aesthetic of late 90s and early 2000s websites, the project creates a playful, immersive experience for users. Visitors can explore a universe of cats, interact with them, and enjoy animation features such as floating elements and nostalgic design motifs. The site also includes background music to enhance the vibe, which users can control through a custom audio toggle button.

## What Was Used
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Technologies:** 
  - CSS animations and transitions
  - JavaScript for interactivity
  - `<audio>` element with custom controls
- **Environment:** Tested locally and deployed using GitHub Pages

## How It Was Made
1. **Concept:** The idea originated from a desire to create a whimsical website showcasing cats in a fun and interactive way during a hackathon. 
2. **Design:** The layout and style emulate the early web era, incorporating vibrant colors, GIFs, and many different things. 
3. **Implementation:** 
   - HTML was structured to feature clickable cat elements, creating unique about pages for each cat.
   - CSS was used extensively for animations, including hover effects and a 3D rotating cube.
   - JavaScript powers the music toggle, allowing users to play, pause, mute, and unmute the background audio.

## What Went Wrong
- Initially, the title bar for a floating div element was misaligned. After trial and error, it was adjusted using precise CSS positioning.
- The autoplay feature for the background music faced browser limitations due to user interaction requirements. This was mitigated by designing a custom play/pause/mute button.
- Early font choices made the text hard to read against the background, which was resolved by adjusting colors and adding bold formatting.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize the site for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
- Add more customization to the audio control, such as volume adjustments and track selection.
- Include a cat customization feature where users can create their own "space cat."

## What I Learned
Building Cataverse improved my understanding of:
- How to implement CSS animations for engaging visual effects.
- JavaScript event handling for creating interactive elements.
- Addressing real-world challenges like browser autoplay restrictions.
- The importance of user experience, readability, and accessibility in web design.

## Resources
Some personal pictures of my cats were used for this project. However, when it comes to the GIFs and buttons, those were obtained from both https://gifcities.org/ and https://plasticdino.neocities.org/ (check out their website; it's really cool!).

Cataverse is a love letter to the nostalgia of early internet culture and the timeless appeal of cats. I hope you enjoy exploring this quirky project as much as I did building it!
